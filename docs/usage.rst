Usage
=====

robofinch was intended to be used with other libraries, most prominently `zftftb <https://github.com/jmarkow/zftftb>`_ and `intan_frontend <https://github.com/jmarkow/intan_frontend>`_. 

How options/parameters are handled
----------------------------------

Because many of these scripts are intended to run without user intervention, parameters are stored in text files.  All robofinch functions read special text files in the directories you want to process.  For instance, say ``/Volumes/my_great_folder_of_data/`` contains data from 4 birds ``LHP57``, ``RB15``, ``LG720RBLK`` and ``RM10``.  You may want a default set of parameters for all birds, you would place a text file with the default options in ``/Volumes/my_great_folder_of_data/``.  What if you want parameter B to be different for ``LHP57``?  Simply place another text file with the setting for parameter B in ``/Volumes/my_great_folder_of_data/LHP57``.  The options files are scanned hierarchically, and are read from first to last.

Computing sound features 
------------------------

.. warning:: This function will not work unless you specify how to read data from your files, see SECTION X

A common usage scenario involves data from an electrophysiology or imaging experiment being parsed by `intan_frontend <https://github.com/jmarkow/intan_frontend>`_.  Now you have a bunch of data aligned to singing in a folder somewhere.  A first step is to compute sound features for all data files.  This is done using ``robofinch_sound_score``, which recurses all directories, checks for sound files, and computes features using ``zftftb_song_score`` and stores them in the subdirectory ``syllable_data`` (history lesson:  the name is a holdover from a software package that preceded this called ``syllable_detector``).  For details on the specific features that are computed see `this section of the zftftb documentation <http://zftftb.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage.html#features-used-for-clustering>`_.  

Open up MATLAB, ``cd`` into a directory that contains data files somewhere.  Say you have lots of data files in various subdirectories in ``/Volumes/my_great_folder_of_data/`` placed by `intan_frontend <https://github.com/jmarkow/intan_frontend>`_::

	>>cd /Volumes/my_great_folder_of_data/
	>>robofinch_sound_score;

``robofinch_sound_clust`` hunts for all files with a specific prefix to compute sound features for, which can be set using the parameter ``filename_filter`` (see table below).  By default, it searches for files that begin with ``songdet1`` and end with ``.mat``, which is the default setting for `intan_frontend <https://github.com/jmarkow/intan_frontend>`_. 

Clustering sounds
-----------------

.. warning:: This function will not work unless you specify how to read data from your files, see SECTION X

If you have used `zftftb <https://github.com/jmarkow/zftftb>`_ to select a template and cluster some data manually, if the option ``train_classifier`` was set to ``true``, then a support vector machine (SVM) is trained to do template matching automatically.  The upshot is you can cluster a day's worth of data manually, then ``robofinch_sound_clust`` automatically extract examples of that template from the rest of your data and all data you collect in the future for the same animal.  

#. After running ``zftftb_song_clust`` with the ``train_classifier`` parameter set to ``1`` or ``true``, cd into the sub-directory with files from your "run"::
	
	>>zftftb_song_clust(pwd,'audio_load',myloadfunction,'train_classifier',1); 

   Assuming that you created a new run and used the name ``testing``::

   	>>cd testing_MANUALCLUST
   	>>ls

   You should see 

		#. cluster_data.mat -> contains a data structure used for clustering
		#. cluster_results.mat -> contains the result of the manual clustering procedure
		#. *classify_data.mat* -> contains the specifications of the support vector machine for automatic clustering
		#. *template_data.mat* -> contains the template 

   You will need ``classify_data.mat`` and ``template_data.mat`` for automatic clustering.  They are copied to a special directory in the hierarchy created by `intan_frontend <https://github.com/jmarkow/intan_frontend>`_ (you do not have to use the hierarchy created by this, as long you follow the same conventions) ``/Volumes/my_great_folder_of_data/[BIRD]/templates/[NAME_OF_TEMPLATE]/``.  Substitute whatever you like with [NAME_OF_TEMPLATE], this will be the name used for automatic template matching.  So let's say you want the template to be named "best_song_A" and the bird's ID is "LHP57", you would do the following

   		#. create the directory ``/Volumes/my_great_folder_of_data/LHP57/templates/best_song_A/``
   		#. copy the files ``classify_data.mat`` and ``template_data.mat`` to the folder you just created
   
#. Now run the following commands::
   
   >>cd /Volumes/my_great_folder_of_data/
   >>robofinch_sound_clust;


Aggregating data
----------------

Use ``robofinch_agg_data``. 

Running function on aggregated data
-----------------------------------

Use ``robofinch_agg_scripts``

The daemon
----------

In all likelihood you will not interact with many of the other functions in the robofinch toolbox, and instead you will run the daemon ``robofinch_daemon``, which runs sound feature calculation, sound clustering, data aggregation, and any custom functions you want to use to generate figures from the aggregated data.
